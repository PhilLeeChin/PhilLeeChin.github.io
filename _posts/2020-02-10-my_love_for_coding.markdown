Why did you decide to learn Software Engineering?

Hello my name is Philip Lee-Chin, first off I would say thanks again to being one out of the many to be accepted into this program, into this school, and to walk on the road that will pave the way on to the career that I dreamed of since high school. I decided to learn Software Engineering from my found love for technology, in high school I became the top in my class very quickly because it was easy for me to grasp the material given and finish the labs in a timely basis. After which I started to open my horizon into hardware diagnostics and software troubleshooting, in my spare time I would do small jobs of performing basic troubleshooting for schools with down computer systems. My fist major job working with a company was as a Scan Coordinator, my resposiblilities was to perfom system checks, troubleshooting systems with errors, and database entries. With these experiences my desire and interest in how programs worked, how webpages are designed, and how video games are created grew stronger.  

It was not until I came to the United States the opportunity to learn and pursue my career dream to become a Programmer was possible. I registered for the Medgar Evers College pursuing an Associates degree in Computer Science, starting out it was not easy, but I was up for the challenge. Through my challenges I met collegues whom became my friends, builing a network where in doubt I can call on them. I was able to learn c++, Java for mobile applications, sql, and docker. Additionally, I learned how to manuever around a linux system, and operating system installations.

My dream is to become the best software engineer I can be, to learn different programing languages and which ones I am strong at, at the moment I have taught myself html and css to create my first webpage, it is still in its editing stage but I am hoping to have it ready by March of this year.

So in a nut shell i decided to lear Software Engineering because, I have found love, enjoyment, fulfillment, the drive, the urge, and the willingness to learn what I can about programming to achieve the career I dreamt of since high school, and mostly to make my Mother proud.
