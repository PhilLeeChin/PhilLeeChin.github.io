Taking on multiple milestones is a challenge especially when those milestones is comprised of college, work, life and an online bootcamp. At the begining of this year I told myself that I will graduate from college by June, leave my current job by the end of this year, and complete the programming course at Flatiron. The first 2 weeks was tough but coming together as a group, making friends and creating a network of like-minded people; with that we were able to pull each other through the crucial first mile that would etch in the stars those who were able to defeat the first mountain.

As we progress some labs prove to be easy and quite straight forward, and then there were others that would make you doubt what you know. Taking the initiative i created a slack group for my new found team to make it easier for us to share ideas, look at each other weaknesses and strength, and help each other surpass those weaknesses. There is this saying, "No man get's left behind" when it comes to my team this is true. Even though I created the group and being the admin, I would not classify myself as their leader because, I do not feel more intellectual than they as they too have taught me new things along the way.

As we approach the dawn of the CLI projects things have been shifted into high gear, the higher we climb the more vague the signs turn to be, frustration builds, tiredness and weary kicks in and at times sleep eludes us. Along the way three more team members have joined, pair partners, ones who we can have 1:1 with to plan new ideas and methods for a new path. My network is growing and so have theirs.

College Life

As life keeps hitting me, and like a heavy bag trying to bare me down. My calculus 2 class proves to be more challenging than it should be. Talks of the professor not being fair in his final grading sends fear to my group who is taking the class. As we try to find means to secure a passing grade, each day just seems more bleak, there is no sign of sunshine or anything. I will hold strong as I have a goal to accomplish.

With so many challenges I can understand why we give in and give up, saying it is too much to bare. I urge you whomever gets to read this blog, nothing in life will come easy, nor will some come at no cost. In the caribbean there is a saying, "if yuh wah gud yuh nose affi run", to translate - sleepless nights, hours of studying, coding, time with family, and time to rest. Nothing comes easy but we must persevere, push on, build that network, that time, that when you on your last leg, that last straw and you feel you have no fight left, trust me they will be right there with you to help you fight on. Always remember there is no "i" in team, but you can get the word meat. - so I urge you don't give up, press on, be strong, build that network or team you need to win.
